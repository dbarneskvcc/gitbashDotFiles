# Gitbash Dot Files

## Author

## Description

A bashrc and a bash_profile file that will do some setup and then load a bash_prompt and bash_aliases that can be used to alter the look of the bash terminal and load some aliases. There is also a minttyrc to alter the colors of the terminal

### Notes

The bashrc and bash_profile may work fine on linux systems as well. But not tested. Linux terminals do not use mintty, so the minttyrc file will not work on there.

You are free to use copy use, and alter this as you see fit. These files were created with learning in mind, and are not subject to any copyright.
